### Nana Analysis

A thing that I have noticed in the way characters and the world interact in fiction is that
there seems to be a great deal of focus on the extravagant. In fiction, there seems to be a fast
sprint to incorporate all the important things in our world such as love and circumstance. And
while all those things are a part of life, the speed at which life moves is certainly slower and has
many roadblocks and hills to get through. To me, fiction seems to pick and choose character
traits and the circumstances of the world that are of the highest grade of significance. In other
words, a neglect for the ordinary. And while the great displays of courage and things falling right
into place (plot armor) (deus ex machina) can create a more appealing story, it can lose out on
the familiarity. Familiarity in fiction is important for one thing: we start to believe rather than
merely acknowledge the messages and sayings that are told to us throughout life. By witnessing
the events being a reality through the friends on the screen. And by creating more familiarity, we
may have a more lasting impact that will resonate with us and allow us to go out with a
heightened perspective and act accordingly. One anime that I believe finds this great balance is
Nana.

Nana distinguishes itself from other works from the slice of life genre by capitalizing on
an aspect of life that is often overlooked, but nonetheless prevalent. A thing that is familiar to all
of us: awkward moments. The times when we depart and proceed to go in the same direction.
The times when we get the wrong idea from an event and go about our lives in the wrong
direction, until finally a resolution. I would define awkward as the unconventional in terms of how
the world is believed to orderly, normally and predictably go about. Of course, we can identify all
the ways in which things go wrong, but what differentiates awkward from a deus ex machina is
the way that life does not shatter the ideal scenes that we have in our minds, but distorts it. In
addition, Nana is masterful in emulating the human experience by having characters react to life
events in the ways a human would.

In the spontaneous nature of life, events go in all sorts of directions. Eventually, there
are moments bound to be colliding and knotting and cutting off one another. And by this,
awkward moments are born. A scenario that I find that illustrates this is through Hachi and
Nobu’s encounter with Takumi. When Nobu gets a call from Hachi’s phone from Takumi, who
was believed to no longer be a part of Nana’s life, Nobu becomes suspicious. He goes to Nana
to know what is going on, but all she could say to him was that she was sorry.
Hachi and Nobu did not work out not because of a fight or conflicting philosophies that
halted interest, but from misunderstandings. From the moment Nobu got the phone call, Hachi
and Nobu were in different realities. Hachi was so concerned with her having hurt Nobu rather
than what Nobu could be thinking. But Nobu could obviously not consider this and who knows
what sorts of crazy things that Nobu could have imagined was the situation. The solution was
right around the corner, which was to communicate, but was unachievable because of the
nature of how the situation was. This demonstrates the awkward. The weird, grimy moments
that are unconventional with the harmonic idea of how things should be. They were unable to
communicate and fix the misunderstanding so they were offset into different realities. A reality
where Hachi has abandoned Nobu for Takumi. A reality where Nobu is no longer a part of
Hachi’s story.

Rather than a forceful ripping of fates, the scenario illustrated here was a slow
unraveling. And by this, I believe that it demonstrates the awkward as the small
misunderstandings and unconventional things and the “should not”s exist and pose as much of
a problem. By illustrating the awkward, it is reflective of the nature of circumstance in our worldmessy
and irregular.

There is a great bit of humanity present in the interaction between Nobu and Hachi. As
people, we tend to only consider the reality for what it shows. We fantasize about the implied
messages between words and the possible context before an encounter, but all fall short
because of the lack of sureness that we have. And to take it a step further, based on the facts
that we learn from the things presented to us, we adapt and form new realities. In this moment,
we relate with Nobu as there are times when we are oblivious to what is truly the reality, which
makes us lose out on a lot of opportunities in life. Granted, we may never know whether or not
we misinterpreted, but we know that it exists, and herein lies a relational attachment that we
may form with the characters.

Continuing on, later, we see Nobu texting Hachi to talk about what has happened.
However, Nobu gets no response. I believe that because of their initial encounter, the encounter
that made Nobu perceive through a window of abandonment, he was able to see this encounter
as one of disinterest and abandonment as well. That he really is out of Hachi’s story and he will
go down further into his hole. However, there is some context behind this. Hachi was unable to
reply because of good reason: not because she disregards Nobu, but because she questions
the motives of whether or not it would be fair to Nobu to talk about it. Would meeting up be
fueled by selfishness? She did not know, and she could not reply.
To me, this instance showcases the complexity of how our world works through depicting
the great nuance that there is to every simple answer. Oftentimes, logic points us towards a
certain direction but our hearts prevent ourselves from seeing to it because of the lurking
skepticism of our motives being impure. The clear choice is to talk to Nobu to resolve what has
happened, even Nobu directly says that’s what he wants, however, Hachi believes that it might
be a disservice to him if she were to do it out of selfish motives. With any good action, we can
always point it back to ourselves in a cynical way. And to me, this is so human. I find myself at
times wondering whether or not I am doing something with altruism or with an ulterior motive.
Viewing things unfold in third person, it’s almost laughable to see the two parties on
completely different pages. However, we stop ourselves because such circumstances, albeit not
in the exact same context, are prone to happening in our world. We are quick to judge and
assume and we rule our intuition as supreme, unaware of the intricacies and nuance of our
present realities. We fall short of understanding others, and understanding ourselves. And
sometimes, the things that are best for us, the things that should be in our favor, do not end up
happening because of the shortcomings of our own humanity in compliance with the unfortunate
unravelings of life circumstances. But beyond the idea that a relatable experience is a cathartic
experience, I believe that fiction transforms the life lessons and messages from mere thoughts
to viewable experiences. It’s one thing to hear something than to see it in action and believe it.
It’s one thing to acknowledge something and another to believe something.
Later, we see that Hachi texts Shin and invites everyone to watch the fireworks, just like
the old days. Hachi was comfortable enough to invite Nobu. In fact, she was gung ho about it as
the time leading up to the event Hachi was very jolly. When given this opportunity, Nobu’s idea
that he is out of Hachi’s story is taken away.
It all goes to plan, all things are in line and clean… until she meets Shoji. After talking
with Shoji, Hachi becomes disheartened.

However, once she encounters Shoji and they talk, Hachi is too sad to go to the event.
Because what just happened pertains to Nobu; Hachi sees Nobu through her situation with
Shoji. Hachi knows how it feels to be on the receiving end of being in the dark about betrayal,
and having to think about what it was about her that made it go wrong. In the end, Hachi and
Shoji make up. But it is also the last time they will see each other. Hachi did not want that, and
she certainly does not want that with Nobu. I don't think that she’s scared that she will fall in
Nobu’s arms because something bad happened and she needs him to comfort her and she will
fall all over him. No, I think she does not want the same thing that happened between her with
Shoji. As well as feeling the weight of how it must feel to be in Nobu’s situation.
With the fireworks invitation, Nobu is given an opportunity that pushes him away from the
idea that Hachi and him are over, but when such opportunity is taken he reverts back to square
one, the square where he was unwilling to do anything because it seems hopeless. The square
where he looks at the evidence on a surface level, unable to interpret the situation properly
because of the thought process that is conformed to his own perceived reality. Nana receives
the call from Hachi and tells Nobu that Hachi is scared of facing Nobu. What this tells Nobu is
that she’s scared of creating problems and losing the happiness that she has. Which is not true,
if she was scared of falling for Nobu again, she wouldn’t have invited the friends over to the
event. Hachi was comfortable enough originally to hang out with Nobu as friends. What Hachi
was scared of Nobu through these new circumstances.

In the end, Nobu was unable to see for himself whether or not Hachi was happy or not.
Hachi’s happiness would have been the decider as to whether or not Nobu would be stepping in
to steal Hachi. But unfortunately, from the information that Nobu was fed, he knew all he needed
to know and the answer was clear to him: Hachi chose Takumi and is scared of facing Nobu
because he would be an infringement to the happiness that she already has. Although it is
somewhat true that Hachi chose Takumi, Nana’s words blew it out of proportion and instilled in
Nobu the wrong idea. Hachi was not afraid of falling in love with Nobu again. Could Nobu have
won over Hachi if it weren’t for the misunderstandings? Probably not, but having no attempt at
all gets rid of all possibilities.

To me, Nana is a reminder that things will not always go in our favor. And this is
communicated very well by creating a world that is reminiscent of our own, by showing the slow,
painful crawl that we must sometimes bear. However, there is more to it. Yes, Nana creates
another outlet of things not going in our favor. But, Nana is also a love letter to the relationships
that did survive the tides of fate. That fate has its favor on such relationships. Because with how
fragile relationships can be, one can be thankful for the great perseverance that came with the
relationship.
