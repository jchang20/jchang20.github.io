This is “Evening: Landscape with an Aqueduct” by Théodore Gericault. This takes place in the ruins of an Italian countryside. Gericault visited this place in 1816 and 1817 and painted it in his Paris studio.   

In a lot of art pieces during the romantic era, we can see that in the landscape there is always some form of light that is central to the piece. It is the part of the work that is the most noticeable, therefore, viewers tend to flock to the light first. But as we expand our gaze outwards and into the other reaches of the painting, it is then revealed to us as viewers that there is more than what meets the eye in the painting. As we drift our eyes into dimmer and dimmer territory in the painting, we begin to slowly encapsulate the painting as a whole. We begin to see that the light is not what makes the artwork, but rather, the concept of light in the painting, and how it brightens the scenery. To me, the light gives objects in the painting life. After being shone by the light, the things in the setting come to life as the vibrant colors are expressed and noticed. There is a sort of grandness to all that is being shone by light: the man made structures in the hills, the aqueduct, two people conversing near the shore. But what about the other sections of the painting? Are they solely there to fill up space? Are they there to enhance the bright scenery as a contrast to the dim?
To me, in this scene, the light that is being cast acts as a form of mana that brings life to the various sections in the scene. The aqueduct, a glorious embodiment of hard work and fruition. The houses in the hills, sanctuaries for rest and communion. However, I would like to say that it is only by the time and place, through chance, that certain parts of the landscape are brought to life. If the painting was set on another time of day, or another angle, perhaps other sections of the landscape would be given life. It is only by the artist’s choice that certain things in the image are casted light. And us, as artists of life, why don’t we paint a scene at a different time or angle, away from the expectations of others and the conventions of society.
