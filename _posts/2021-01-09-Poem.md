There lies a place 
A place of birds chirping and lovers communing 
A place of vivid color, visual and emotional
A place with no tears, and if such, only the beautiful kind 
A place with no bathroom breaks and tripping on the road 
A place with smooth water and flat terrain for miles a go
A place, a beautiful place 
But evermore a place that brings calamity 
From the beckoning distance I am
Away
From the screen
